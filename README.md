# mallardduck/mtg-cards-sdk

Tap into the Magic: Simplify Card Data Access with our generated static PHP SDK.

This project `mallardduck/mtg-cards-sdk` provides a native PHP (POPO) implementation for MTG card database.
All the files in `src` are autogenerated based on the [MTGJSON](https://mtgjson.com/) database.


## Installation

For the starting point, just use `composer`

```sh
composer create-project mallardduck/mtg-cards-sdk your-project-name
```

Or, check out the git project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mallardduck/mtg-cards-sdk.git
```

## Usage

You will find `Sets` and `Cards` classes that provide static methods to access each entry.
Both of these will have a `fromName` method to resolve the card from readable name.


## TODO:
* Add mechanism to sync latest MTGJSON db blob.
* Add mechanism to verify MTGHSON blob even needs to be fetched. (Prefetch HEAD request?)
* TBD
